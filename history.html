                    <i class="fas fa-quote-left text-blue-800"></i> A ballerina and a banker walk into a barre… In 2005, Jennifer Maanavi and Tanya Becker joined forces to create Physique 57, the world’s premiere barre fitness program. Driven by their passion for empowering people’s bodies and minds, they committed to making their innovative workout accessible worldwide.</p>
                    <p>When they met, they had both discovered the same problem – the fitness industry was lacking trustworthy brands that offered high intensity, low impact, healthy and fun workouts that women could perform safely through every stage of life. Most classes delivered inconsistent results; were not customized for a female body; and caused injury due to repetitive motion and boredom from a low energy experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>Fun facts about Physique 57 include its celebrity endorsements, with stars like Sarah Jessica Parker and Kelly Ripa praising the workouts, which helped elevate the brand's visibility. The founders also published a book titled The Physique 57 Solution, which outlines their fitness philosophy and includes a two-week diet plan. Today, Physique 57 offers a variety of classes, including virtual options, and emphasizes building a supportive community among its members, continually evolving its programs to stay relevant in the fitness industry.
                    </p>
                <p>
                    Teaming up with Tanya Becker, one of the top instructors from The Lotte Berk Method, Jennifer reimagined the fitness experience. Physique 57 debuted in 2006, blending traditional techniques with innovative methods, achieving overwhelming success and global expansion.

     </i>
     <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        Physique 57 was one of the first barre-based, boutique fitness studios to pop up in New York City in 2006. It was born from Jennifer and Tanya’s shared love of the original barre class, The Lotte Berk Method. With a deep understanding of how barre workouts can strengthen, lengthen and tone with incredibly fast results, they designed their signature 57-minute workout.<br><br>     
        The Physique 57 approach helped jumpstart a global boutique fitness phenomenon, becoming a fast favorite of wellness enthusiasts like Kelly Ripa and Sarah Jessica Parker. Just months after opening, even the waitlists had waitlists.

     </i>
     <p class="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        In 2013, Physique 57 led the barre sensation overseas, opening its first studio in Dubai. It has since expanded around the world, with multiple locations across the U.S., Dubai, Bangkok, and Mumbai. <br><br><br>To help clients bring fitness into their homes and daily lives, the method was released as a DVD workout series in 2009 and quickly converted into fresh, online workout challenges. Now with studios in 4 countries, multiple digital platforms with clients and subscribers in all 50 states and over 65 countries, the Physique 57 community grows stronger every day.
